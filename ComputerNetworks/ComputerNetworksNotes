Computer Networks

OSI(open System Inteerconnection) is a reference model given by the ISO(Internet Standard Orgainization)

It have 7 Layers:
1 Application Layer:
    It is the Layer that contains the bunch of protocols like Http,Https,DNS,SMTP FTP etc.
    This layer uses the software like brower,skype etc to use that protocols.

2 Presentation Layer:
    Translation: It is used to convert ascii/unicode to the binary code
    Data Compression: It is used to compress the data like text/video/audio (using huffman algo)
    Encryption: It is also sued to encrypt the data using ssl or tsl(modern)

3 Session Layer:
    It is used to manage,terminate and Established the connections.
    And also checked for the authorization and authentication
    authentication: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system by checking their credentials (such as a username, password, or other forms of identification) to ensure they are genuine.
    authorization: Authorization is the process of determining whether a user or system has the necessary permissions to access a specific resource or perform a certain action, based on their roles or access rights.

4 Transport Layer:
    Segmentaion:
        It is a Process of dividing the data into the segments is called segmentation.
        each segment have 3 things data, port no, seq no.
    Flow Control:
        It is used to control the flow of data (means speed) between host and server.
    Error Control:
        CheckSum and automatic repeat request

5 Network Layer:
    Packets: It is basically a collection of source address and the destination address and the segments called packets which travels over internet.
    Logical-adressing:  It involves assigning unique identifiers (addresses) to devices on a network to facilitate communication across interconnected networks.
    Routing: Routing is the process used by the network layer of the OSI model (or the Internet layer in the TCP/IP model) to determine the best path for data packets to travel from a source to a destination across interconnected networks.
    Path-determination: It is used to find the best path from Host to the server.

6 Datalink Layer:
     Framing: The Data Link Layer encapsulates raw packets into frames (structured data units) for transmission and head(mac src and mac dest) and tail into it.
     Flow Control: Manage the rate of transmission of data.
     Physical Addressing: Uses MAC (Media Access Control) addresses to uniquely identify devices on a local network.
7 Physical Layer:
     It work is to convert the bits to the signals.

Topologies: It is used to show how the physical layout of the nodes connected to each other in a network.
exmples: mesh,ring,bus,tree etc.

Data Link Layer in Detail:
--------------------------
    framing: It is used to convert the packets into the frames.
    media-access-control: It is also used to give the media-access control(means suppose in a bus topology there are two nodes wanted to communicates so, it is control by it).
    error-detection: It is also used in error detection to find the errors.
    control-flows: It is also controlling the flow of data.
    physically addressing: Allocating the MAC address to all the physical devices with in the network.

Delays are of two types:
    Transmission Delay: It is defined aas the time is taken from the creation of frame and send it to the cable.

    Propagation Delay: It is defined as the time which is used travel the frame from the start of the src cable to the destination of the cable.

And for each of the following features we use some algo and protocols for it to implements.

    Flow Controls:
    --------------
    For flow controls we used STOP AND WAIT ARQ(Automatic repeating Request)
